Project Analysis: Supermarket Checkout System Refactoring and Extension
1. Introduction
   This document provides a detailed analysis of the refactoring process and feature implementation for the Supermarket Checkout System. The initial state of the project presented significant challenges in terms of maintainability and extensibility, primarily due to a monolithic design and lack of automated tests.
   The primary objectives of this initiative were:
1.
To refactor the existing codebase to make it open for extension and easier to maintain, adhering to modern software design principles.
2.
To introduce a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
3.
To implement two new features: Discounted Bundles and Loyalty Programmes.
This analysis will proceed on a class-by-class and package-by-package basis to detail the changes made to achieve these objectives.
2. Core System Refactoring for Extensibility
   The most significant architectural issue was located in the ShoppingCart.handleOffers method. This method contained a large, complex series of if-else statements, making it a classic example of a feature envy code smell and a direct violation of the Open/Closed Principle. Any new offer type required a modification to this central, fragile method.
   The refactoring focused on replacing this structure with the Strategy Design Pattern.
   2.1. New Package: dojo.supermarket.strategy
   To encapsulate the logic for different special offers, a new package dojo.supermarket.strategy was created.
   •
   OfferStrategy Interface: This interface defines the contract for all special offer calculations. It contains a single method, applyOffer, which takes the necessary context (like product quantity and price) and returns a Discount object.
   •
   Concrete Strategy Classes: For each type of special offer, a corresponding class implementing OfferStrategy was created:
   ◦
   ThreeForTwoStrategy
   ◦
   TwoForAmountStrategy
   ◦
   FiveForAmountStrategy
   ◦
   TenPercentDiscountStrategy
   ◦
   Each class contains the specific logic for its corresponding offer, completely isolated from other offer types.
   2.2. Changes in dojo.supermarket.model.Teller
   The Teller class was refactored to orchestrate the application of these strategies, removing the burden from the ShoppingCart.
   •
   Decoupling from ShoppingCart: The handleOffers method was removed from ShoppingCart. The responsibility for applying discounts is now fully managed by the Teller.
   •
   Strategy Selection: The Teller now holds a map of SpecialOfferType to its corresponding OfferStrategy. When checking out, it iterates through the cart items, identifies which offer applies, and delegates the discount calculation to the appropriate strategy object.
   •
   Extensibility: With this new design, adding a new type of special offer is a simple, low-risk process:
   i.
   Create a new class that implements OfferStrategy.
   ii.
   Add the new SpecialOfferType enum value.
   iii.
   Register the new strategy in the Teller. This process requires no modification to any existing, tested code.
3. Implementation of New Features
   The new, flexible architecture was then leveraged to implement the required new features.
   3.1. New Feature: Discounted Bundles
   A system for handling discounts on bundles of different items was implemented.
   •
   New Package: dojo.supermarket.model.bundle:
   ◦
   DiscountBundle: A model class was created to represent a bundle, containing a list of products and the total bundle price.
   •
   New Package: dojo.supermarket.manager:
   ◦
   BundleManager: This class encapsulates the logic for managing and applying bundle discounts. It is initialized in the Teller and is invoked during the checkout process. It checks if the items in the ShoppingCart match any defined bundles and, if so, calculates and adds the appropriate Discount to the Receipt.
   3.2. New Feature: Loyalty Programmes
   A customer loyalty program was added to calculate and track points.
   •
   New Package: dojo.supermarket.model.loyalty:
   ◦
   LoyaltyProgram: This model class defines the rules of the loyalty program, such as the points awarded per euro spent.
   •
   New Manager in dojo.supermarket.manager:
   ◦
   LoyaltyProgramManager: This class handles the logic for calculating loyalty points based on the final price of the Receipt. It is invoked by the Teller at the end of the checkout process.
   •
   Modification to dojo.supermarket.model.Receipt: The Receipt class was updated to store the number of loyalty points earned for the transaction, making this information available for display or further processing.
4. Testing Strategy
   A robust testing strategy was fundamental to the success of this refactoring effort.
   •
   Acceptance and Regression Testing: The SupermarketTest.java file utilizes Cucumber to define high-level acceptance tests. These tests describe the expected behavior of the system from a user's perspective. They were created before the refactoring to act as a safety net, ensuring that the internal changes did not alter the system's output.
   •
   Unit Testing for New Features: To validate the correctness of the new functionalities, dedicated unit tests were created:
   ◦
   DiscountBundleTest.java: This test class ensures that the BundleManager correctly identifies bundles in the cart and applies the right discounts.
   ◦
   LoyaltyProgramTest.java and LoyaltyProgramManagerTest.java: These tests verify that loyalty points are calculated correctly according to the defined rules.
   This comprehensive, multi-layered testing approach provided the confidence needed to refactor the legacy code and guaranteed the quality of the new features.
5. Conclusion
   The Supermarket Checkout System has been successfully transformed from a rigid and fragile application into a flexible, maintainable, and extensible system. By applying the Strategy Design Pattern, we have made the core logic for handling discounts compliant with the Open/Closed Principle. The introduction of manager classes for new features like Discounted Bundles and Loyalty Programmes demonstrates the viability of the new architecture.
   The entire process was underpinned by a comprehensive test suite, ensuring that all changes were implemented correctly and without regressions. The project now fully meets the requirements for extensibility and has been enhanced with the requested new features. Zrób z tego markdown po angielsku bez emotek. Nie zmieniaj tresci.

# Project Analysis: Supermarket Checkout System Refactoring and Extension

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed analysis of the refactoring process and feature implementation for the Supermarket Checkout System. The initial state of the project presented significant challenges in terms of maintainability and extensibility, primarily due to a monolithic design and lack of automated tests.

The primary objectives of this initiative were:

1. To refactor the existing codebase to make it open for extension and easier to maintain, adhering to modern software design principles.
2. To introduce a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
3. To implement two new features: Discounted Bundles and Loyalty Programmes.

This analysis will proceed on a class-by-class and package-by-package basis to detail the changes made to achieve these objectives.

## 2. Core System Refactoring for Extensibility
The most significant architectural issue was located in the `ShoppingCart.handleOffers` method. This method contained a large, complex series of if-else statements, making it a classic example of a feature envy code smell and a direct violation of the Open/Closed Principle. Any new offer type required a modification to this central, fragile method.

The refactoring focused on replacing this structure with the Strategy Design Pattern.

### 2.1. New Package: `dojo.supermarket.strategy`
To encapsulate the logic for different special offers, a new package `dojo.supermarket.strategy` was created.

- **OfferStrategy Interface**: This interface defines the contract for all special offer calculations. It contains a single method, `applyOffer`, which takes the necessary context (like product quantity and price) and returns a `Discount` object.
- **Concrete Strategy Classes**: For each type of special offer, a corresponding class implementing `OfferStrategy` was created:
    - `ThreeForTwoStrategy`
    - `TwoForAmountStrategy`
    - `FiveForAmountStrategy`
    - `TenPercentDiscountStrategy`

Each class contains the specific logic for its corresponding offer, completely isolated from other offer types.

### 2.2. Changes in `dojo.supermarket.model.Teller`
The `Teller` class was refactored to orchestrate the application of these strategies, removing the burden from the `ShoppingCart`.

- **Decoupling from ShoppingCart**: The `handleOffers` method was removed from `ShoppingCart`. The responsibility for applying discounts is now fully managed by the `Teller`.
- **Strategy Selection**: The `Teller` now holds a map of `SpecialOfferType` to its corresponding `OfferStrategy`. When checking out, it iterates through the cart items, identifies which offer applies, and delegates the discount calculation to the appropriate strategy object.
- **Extensibility**: With this new design, adding a new type of special offer is a simple, low-risk process:
    1. Create a new class that implements `OfferStrategy`.
    2. Add the new `SpecialOfferType` enum value.
    3. Register the new strategy in the `Teller`.

This process requires no modification to any existing, tested code.
